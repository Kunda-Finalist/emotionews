France is the mother of all problems in Francophone countries,
 France is fighting to protect its interests in that region including the uranium mines which it uses to power its nuclear reactors that generate electricity which oy sells to the rest of Europe while Africans continue to languish in darkness,

"No unite, no love among africans. If we loved each others and were united, we could stop all these nonsense. It is not about France or any one else, it is about we Black people.",
Why would they fool us ...France is just fighting to protect it's interest in mali which is the uranium found in the country,
They created it in order to steal Uranium and avoid Tax in Mali this army deployment comes to Mali at a high cost of it natural resouces,
I think only France can answer the question,
"Because France has business in there, that why.",
 Is France really doing that,
They still searching for Mansa Musa’s left gold.,
Let's hope they're not there to discover more resources.,
The uranium mines in Niger & uranium deposits in Mali are of interest to France as it generates 78% of its electricity from nuclear energy,
France is only interested uranium in Mali,

The agenda of some plutocratic oligarch to pollute the stand of democracy even in a civilian administration is a no and not acceptable for effective governance..if there is aban to freedom of expression there should also be a ban to propaganda.,

the bill should be passed... I support that bill hate speech is very harmful to the peace of any nation especially hate speech on social media.,

"The reconciliation started with the symbolic ""handshake"" between Uhuru and Raila which kind of eased tribal tension. Judgment on the proposed BBI Initiative can't be made yet since we will know of the exact contents once it is rolled out. ",
" Rwanda has showed us that people can heal, pick up the pieces and go on as a united country. I admire Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta for the courage they took and shook hands in a time when hatred was devouring our beautiful country. They did it against some of their political party companions, the result being our country is breathimg a different air today.",
Healing takes long. Some may have forgiven but forgetting is difficult especially if there is a scar (including loss of a family member). I pray for healing and peace to everyone who was affected,
"Kenyans and it's canning yet myopic leaders need to remember that, the problem has never been the lack of the ever numerous laws/polices and reports from endless UNIMPLEMENTED commissions. keyword-UNIMPLEMENTED. The relactance of implementation is what is ailing Kenya.",
As for me I don't see any healing here. I've been seeing it as a selfish interest for the two leaders. I don't see Ruto letting his ambitions of being the president of Kenya go silence. He will feel betrayed by Uhuru and this will make Kenyans fight again.,
"President Kenyatta & opposition leader Raila Odinga are champion for peace & reconciliation . Good job Kenyans, this is good example for Africa.",
"Kenya is and will always remain a Democratic state ...Kenyans enjoy freedom of speech, good healthcare, interaction, to demonstrate,media freedom,religion etc the issue we have in Kenya is the youth unemployment,wide pool of untapped ICT talent slow industrialisation corruption though there has been much efforts to fight the menace and of course the alshabab threat which so far has been neutralized",
"The long journey start with a single step. The united ants can build up the mountain. The handshake in Kenya promote social cohesion and great peace in our country Kenya. Alone we are weak, but together we are strong. ",
After this BBI report I now lost confidence in the leadership of this country. I am now convinced that the only way kenya can get total reform is through popular uprising. There is disconnect between the leadership and the ordinary Poor citizens..,
The BBI is selfish interest and has no significance for Kenyans. It heals only certain politicians and left the larger Kenyans to live in appalling and abject poverty.,
This is really great if egos are put aside and a nation is first because the country will for ever stay but governments change so what's the purpose of destorying a nation just because someone disagrees on results of an election.,
Healing is a journey which each person take their own length of time to heal.,
God gave us a burden called Raila Amollo odinga. This is the only problem we have in our country.,
Kenyan politics is about the rich and their interests. Whenever those interests are not met they’ll still have a way to have the poor majority fight each other on tribal lines. I have experienced post-election violence first hand. The media plays a key role in polarizing people. Nothing will change.,
In Bentiu town South Sudan It's really a good move to all Kenyans citizens by reconciling and building a trusth relationship toward peace in the country,
 We are not happy at all here in kenya and we can't either forget the pain,
The healing has been attained through a magical (read Money) handshake.,
"AU is to blame for always endorsing rigged elections in Africa and therefore establishing political instability in Africa... Good example is Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique etc",
"I don't, think so if they have refused the constitution law which is 10 yrs and above.2nd politics is about the rich and interest.poor civilian being caught in the conflict.3rd the magic handshake is ready money.4th the pain is gone but not forgotten.hard to swallow.5th the poison tribalism to be uprootet.sure cameloon knows to use it,s colours.there,s secret deal behind curtain for Uhuru and raila and Ruth feels betrayed.",
"BBI will just be the expand the ethnic violence in kenya.keep watch and know the parliamentary system will create regional division and bribery ,this will end up ethnic violence.",
"At 2:06 during the interview, the reporter cuts Mr. Tall off when he speaks of Reparations. He even laughs and interjects, ‘ I thought you would say you are going to sell the sword.’ It must be worth a lot, he added.",
The british goverment must bring back broken hill man skull to zambia too.,
Bring back our artifacts ohhhh. Africa is the world.,
We need the Gold and Diamonds back as well. Don't give us sword back to kill. ,
"England, Portugal, France, Germany, Belgium, China...the countries that assume they are the custodians of African relics/art, which in fact they looted during the Scramble for Africa.",
"France and the likes has not just sword to return to Africa but the gold and reparations, we are highly expectant.....",
Bring back our Africa arts and collect your bibles,
We need back our natural resources not a sword.,
 I hope they returned whatever cash generated from showing the sword to the public over the years,
So when are they bringing the original one... I'm just asking for a friend.,
"The ""Sword of Life"".",
They should have returned them with 100s of million dollars as compensation for misappropriated antiquities...,
"If this is real, then it means a lot to us. It maybe just a mere knife, but it also tells the world that France stole from Africans and they have accepted the accusations by returning one of the stolen items. Is a process we are willing to follow judiciously irrespective of how much time it will cost us to achieve that",
LOANED! Not returned. They LOANED you your own property back. Title is misleading...,
What about all the other artifacts that they stole.,
We want the gold and diamon not sword,
How did they get the sword? By conquest. They are now building precision guided missiles and we are here talking about sword. They will come back for the sword and much more.,
They should also return the wealth they steal every year .,
I wonder. Note the gentleman in the middle with a pensive look and a slanted mouth.,
Why did the French not hand it over themselves? Are they scared of their own shadows?,
"Wow, I thought Zambia would be on this list.. It must be way worse out there then",
Zambia we always enjoying we even redeem some free bundles every month,
Malawi very expensive to use internet and yet they provide poor quality internet.,
Some of us are really grateful right now!,
"Data is expensive guys, nd its obvious these mobile service providers take advantage of us here in Malawi all the internet service providers r NGO's, if the government owned an internet service provider with the aim of souly providing services, then its cheap prices would force NGO's to charge fair prices, but we have an idiot who either never took economics or is too old to remember, running our country",
And this is madness since much of the elements we use for our mobile phones comes from the DRC,
In Kenya we even have free Facebook. The country with the fastest internet connectivity in Africa.majority use mobile data which is cheap because there are many internet providers in the country.,
This is madness! No one should have to trade their shoes or meals for internet connectivity. Certainly not in 2019....,
Now I know why these countries are falsely being referred to be poorest in world.,
Surprised that Uganda is not among them. Here we pay extra money for social media tax.,
"Ishi in Malawi 1 gig is about 2.3 dollars,i thought we were the worst but DRC is hell on earth",
"For me, the expiry part of the high cost of purchase is highly criminal and exploitative of the poor consumer.",
Thank God I cn get 1.5GB weekly bundle for less than a $0.88 here in Zambia,
Yet it's 1 of the poorest and most deadliest,
And yet these are some of the most poor states ,
MALAWI!! YOU CAN EVEN SELL YOUR LIFE TO BUY BUNDLE SO THAT UR FAMILY CAN ASSESS INTERNET,
How come Zimbabwe is not on the list?... The data tariffs have become absurd!,
Thank God there is free mode in Kamerun,
Congo must be hell... There is absolutely nothing good about this country ,
"Ghana is the cheapest comparatively, somehow fast also..",
